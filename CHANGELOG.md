    ~ [#163](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/163)
    / [@avonmoll](https://github.com/avonmoll)

### Changed
- The heuristic-based master file search is now disabled by default.
  If you want this functionality, simply go to the package settings and enable
  the *Use Master File Search* option.

## [0.31.0] / 2016-03-12
### Added
- Optional functionality for automatically building a file after it has been
  saved. To avoid possible race conditions that could potentially be triggered
  by *Save All*, automatic builds are only triggered on the active file.  
    ~ [#152](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/152)
    / [@ravinrabbid](https://github.com/ravinrabbid)

## [0.30.0] / 2016-03-02
### Added
- After a LaTeX file has been built it gets decorated with line number markers
  to indicate which lines contain errors and warnings.  
    ~ [#167](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/167)
    / [@Focus](https://github.com/Focus)
- The pdf-view opener now supports forward-sync.  
    ~ [#170](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/170)
    / [@nsaje](https://github.com/nsaje)

### Changed
- Improved the package settings; better descriptions, explicit and more logical
  option ordering, etc.

### Fixed
- Bug related to undefined `editor.getPath()` for new editor instances.  
    ~ [#167](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/167)
    / [@Focus](https://github.com/Focus)

## [0.29.0] / 2015-01-28
### Added
- Adds support for specifying output format (PDF, PS, DVI). Note that this
  currently only works when using the latexmk builder.  
    ~ [#143](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/143)
    / [@sometea](https://github.com/sometea)

### Changed
- The *Clean* command now behaves as expected together with the *Output
  Directory* configuration setting.  
    ~ [#156](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/156)
    / [@Poeschl](https://github.com/Poeschl)
- The default keybinds now only trigger on LaTeX documents (technically this
  means that the grammar scope must contain the substring `latex`). Hence the
  [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex) package is now a
  requirement for the default keybinds to work.  
    ~ [#148](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/148)
    / [@pgbross](https://github.com/pgbross)

## [0.28.2] / 2015-10-26

    / [@m0nhawk](https://github.com/m0nhawk)

## [0.28.0] / 2015-10-26
### Added
- "engine magic" support to the texify builder.  
    ~ [#133](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/133)
    / [@m0nhawk](https://github.com/m0nhawk)

## [0.27.1] / 2015-10-21
### Fixed

- Incorrect single qoute in regexp replaced with double quote.

## [0.27.0] / 2015-10-21
### Added
- Support for specifying the engine to build a specific file with via a "magic
  comment" at the beginning of the file.  
    ~ [#131](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/131)
    / [@redw0lf](https://github.com/redw0lf)

## [0.26.0] / 2015-10-04
### Added
- More default extensions to the clean extensions.  
    ~ [#117](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/117)
    / [@EdJoPaTo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo)
- Support for Okular as the default PDF application on Linux.  
    ~ [#124](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/124)
    / [@WoodyWoodsta](https://github.com/WoodyWoodsta)

## [0.25.1] / 2015-08-21
### Added

    `%SystemDrive%\\texlive\\2015\\bin\\win32`
    `/Library/TeX/texbin`

### Changed
- The `texify` default command arguments now matches the `latexmk` builder.
- Improved notification messages specific to `TexifyBuilder`.
- Use `%SystemDrive%`, `%ProgramFiles`, and `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` environment
  variables on Windows systems.  
    ~ [#103](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/103)
    / [@idleberg](https://github.com/idleberg)

### Fixed
- Typo in `TexifyBuilder` related to notifications.
- Wrap `CustomOpener` path in quotes to support paths containing spaces.  
    ~ [#114](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/114)
    / [@ahoereth](https://github.com/ahoereth)

## [0.25.0] / 2015-07-05
### Added
- Introduces a new builder for MiKTeX's `texify`.
- Support for specifying a customer opener.

### Changed
- *Clean* command now has default shortcut `ctrl-alt-c`.

## [0.24.2] / 2015-06-19
### Fixed
- Explicitly set the current working directory.
  Fixes [#87](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/87).

## [0.24.1] / 2015-05-31
### Added
- New option `alwaysOpenResultInAtom` which allows specifying that results
  should always be opened in Atom, using the pdf-viewer package.

### Changed
- Improved how we determine opener executable existence.

### Fixed
- Increased process' max buffer size to 50 MB.
  Fixes [#88](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/88).

## [0.24.0] / 2015-05-23
### Changed
- Clicking the error indicator in the status bar now opens the associated log
  file instead of opening the developer console, and in addition attempts to
  scroll to the first error.

## [0.23.4] / 2015-05-12
### Fixed
- Ensure `Composer::shouldMoveResult` behaves as expected.
  Fixes [#80](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/80).

## [0.23.3] / 2015-05-11
- Bug caused by breaking change in fs-plus.
  Fixes [#78](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/78).

## [0.23.2] / 2015-05-07
### Fixed
- Ensure we always bootstrap properly.

## [0.23.1] / 2015-05-07
### Fixed
- Launch SumatraPDF with `execFile` instead of `exec`.
  Fixes [#77](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/77).

## [0.23.0] / 2015-05-07
Migration from CoffeeScript to Babel.

Ideally this should have been a major release since we're migrating away
from CoffeeScript to ES6/ES7 via the Babel transpiler (built into Atom). But
since we're not yet ready for v1.0.0, this major release is tagged as a
minor release.

## [0.22.0] / 2015-04-21
### Fixed
- `Composer:getEditorDetails` now always returns an object.
  Fixes [#74](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/74).

## [0.21.0] / 2015-04-06
### Added
- Feature flag for the (naive) master file search feature. The feature
  attempts to search for a master file if we determine that the current file
  is not a master file. And this is determined naively by presence, or lack
  thereof, a `\documentclass` declaration. This does not work well in all
  scenarios, so for the time being the feature can be disabled via the new
  feature flag *Use Master File Search* (`atom.useMasterFileSearch`).
  NOTE: This does not affect the *Magic Comments* feature.

## [0.20.0] / 2015-03-17
### Added
- Experimental, out-of-the-box support for MiKTeX 2.9 by adding default
  MiKTeX paths to the default TeX paths on Windows;
  - `C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64`,
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin`.

### Changed
- Improved TeX path resolution by changing the old behavior of only using the
  `PATH` environment variable in the *Latexmk* child process' `PATH` environment
  variable if the resolved TeX path contains the `$PATH` substitution marker.
  Substitutions are still supported, but the new default is to not use it,
  and when it's not present, the inherited `PATH` environment variable is
  appended to the configured TeX path instead.
- Default *SumatraPDF* path changed to
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\SumatraPDF\SumatraPDF.exe`.

### Fixed
- Soft wrap bug caused by incorrect usage of `getCursorScreenPosition()`.  
    ~ [#68](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/68)
    / [@jacoblchapman](https://github.com/jacoblchapman)

## [0.19.1] / 2015-03-02
### Fixed
- Properly handle undefined results from parser.

## [0.19.0] / 2015-03-02
### Changed
- Improved the error logging scheme slightly, including better error messages
  for missing builder executables, e.g.`latexmk` caused by an incorrectly
  configured *TeX Path*.
- Extensions used by the *Clean* command are now properly configurable.
  **NOTE:** The command doesn't yet work properly together with *Output
  Directory* setting.
- Tweaked the config schema descriptions.

### Fixed
- Bugs related to missing files during move, and missing information in log
  file during parsing (e.g. partially failed build).

## [0.18.1] / 2015-02-09
### Fixed
- Resolved `NullReferenceException` bug.
  Fixes [#53](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/53).

## [0.18.0] / 2015-02-06
### Fixed
- Bug triggered by the text "Output written on .." missing from log file, while
  at the same time `latexmk` returned status code 0 (i.e. "success"). This
  caused the `outputFilePath` key on the log parsing result to equal 'null' and
  this value thus incorrectly ended up in paths etc. Missing output file info
  is now **always** treated as an error.

## [0.17.0] / 2015-02-05
### Changed
- Implemented file extension checking prior to invoking a build.
  Right now supported file extensions are `.tex` and `.lhs`. These might be
  configurable in the future unless the entire concept gets re-engineered once
  support for other builders/compilers besides *Latexmk* get implemented.

### Fixed
- Bug caused by incorrect assumption of a log file always being generated by a
  build; moved volatile log parsing result usage to deeper scope.

## [0.16.1] / 2015-02-02
### Fixed
- Resolve deprecated Atom API usage.

## [0.16.0] / 2015-01-28
### Added
- Support for cross-platform and Windows PDF viewers.  
    ~ [#48](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/48)
    / [@nscaife](https://github.com/nscaife)
- *Clean* feature that deletes temporary files generated during build.  
    ~ [#47](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/47)
    / [@nscaife](https://github.com/nscaife)

### Fixed
- Issue with config schema loading being deferred due to package only being
  activated on triggering *Build* (or *Clean*). The workaround was to disable
  delayed package activation, so this will likely need to be revisited in the
  future.
- Deprecation warning in `keymaps/latex.cson`.  
    ~ [#44](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/44)
    / [@evandromr](https://github.com/evandromr)

## [0.15.2] / 2015-01-20
### Changed
- Update required Atom version to `>0.170.0`.

## [0.15.1] / 2015-01-20
### Fixed
- Bug related to paths containing spaces.
  Fixes [#42](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/42).

## [0.15.0] / 2015-01-19
### Added
- Engine customization. Default engine is still `pdflatex`, but users can now
  use e.g. `xelatex` instead. This is controlled via configuration.  
    ~ [#39](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/39)
    / [@maxxk](https://github.com/maxxk)
- Support for *Literal Haskell* filetypes.  
    ~ [#40](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/40)
    / [@aclemen1](https://github.com/aclemen1)

## [0.14.0] / 2014-11-02
### Added
- Forward-sync support for Skim. Also lays the groundwork for other openers with
  sync support. Default keybind is `ctrl-alt-s`.  
    ~ [#31](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/31)
    / [@urdh](https://github.com/urdh)

## [0.13.0] / 2014-10-22
### Added
- Basic error log parsing routines. Only handles the simplest of scenarios, and
  needs to be expanded.

### Changed
- By default we now move the output file after a successful build, including
  the SyncTeX file if it exists. The files are moved to the source directory,
  i.e. the directory containing the processed root TeX file.
  - The behavior is configurable via `latex.moveResultToSourceDirectory`.
- Improved configuration descriptions.

## [0.12.0] / 2014-10-06
### Added
- Error status indicator to the status bar.  
    ~ [#12](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/12)
    / [@boborbt](https://github.com/boborbt)
- Basic support for parsing magic comments.
- Master/root TeX file feature which supports both magic comments and a
  heuristic search algorithm. If building a descendant TeX file, this feature
  ensures the root file is built instead.  
    ~ [#13](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/13)
    / [@boborbt](https://github.com/boborbt)
- Support for opening the resulting PDF after a successful build. Behavior is
  configurable.  
    ~ [#24](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/24)
    / [@boborbt](https://github.com/boborbt)
- Added a basic Skim.app opener.
  Used by default if Skim.app exists at the configured path which defaults to
  `/Applications/Skim.app`.

### Changed
- Improved platform detection routines, which ultimately improves support for
  Windows.
- Migrated configuration to the new JSON schema approach supported by Atom for
  an improved user experience.

## [0.11.0] / 2014-07-01
### Changed
- Improved the error messages to help users debug e.g. bad `PATH`.  
    ~ [#10](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/10)
    / [@thedataking](https://github.com/thedataking)

## [0.10.0] / 2014-06-25
### Changed
- Refactored code to minimize direct dependence on `latexmk` in an attempt
  to prepare for future support of other TeX builders.
- Lots of improvements to overall code quality, and test coverage.

## [0.9.0] / 2014-05-11
### Added
- Simple progress indicator.

## [0.8.0] / 2014-05-09
### Fixed
- Issues due to filenames containing spaces.
  For reference see
    [#5](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/5) and
    [#7](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues/7).

## [0.7.0] / 2014-05-04
### Added
- Enables generation of SyncTeX file, although it doesn't do anything yet.

### Changed
- Switch error log style to `file:line`.
- Only set `PATH` environment variable on the actual child process that
  executes `latexmk`, instead of setting it for the entire Atom process.
- Overall improvement of code quality, and simplicity.

## [0.6.0] / 2014-04-23
### Changed
- When the package is activated, sets `process.env.PATH` equal to the
  configured `latex.texPath` value.

## [0.5.0] / 2014-04-06
### Added
- Support for `-shell-escape`.

## [0.4.0] / 2014-03-17
### Changed
- The `latexmk` executable is now run asynchronously.  
    ~ [#1](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/pull/1)
    / [@lucas-clemente](https://github.com/lucas-clemente)

## [0.3.0] / 2014-03-14
### Added
- Introduced *Build* menu item.

### Fixed
- Not properly handling `editor` being undefined/null.

## [0.2.0] / 2014-03-13
### Added
- Package configuration.
