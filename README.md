# LaTeX package [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex)
A simple package for Atom that compiles LaTeX files by invoking latexmk.

## Installing
Use the Atom package manager and search for "latex", or run `apm install latex`
from the command line.

## Usage
Invoke the `build` command by pressing the default keybind `ctrl-alt-b` while in
a .tex file.

## Status
Please note that this package is in an **alpha** state. Right now everything is
very na√Øve. As an example, there's no real error handling; the package merely
prints an error message to the console indicating that an error occurred during
the build, and to check the log file manually...

The package is currently hardcoded to typeset using pdfTeX. This will be
configurable in a future release.

## TODO
Current wish list, in a semi-prioritized order.

- [x] Progress indicator.
- [ ] Build output.
 - [ ] Error handling.
 - [ ] Warnings, and other non-critical messages.
- [ ] BibTeX autocompletion support.
- [ ] Open PDF automatically.
 - [ ] Configurable.
- [ ] Support for compilers other than latexmk.
 - [ ] Add support for non-PDF typesetting (e.g. dvi).
- [ ] Project management.
 - [ ] Setting to override the output directory.
 - [ ] Setting to override the builder.
